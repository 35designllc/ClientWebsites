Website link? (that I sent over to you for carriers to register with me) 
If the website link doesn't qualify for one of the pages I'll come up with another page to substitute

We don't have any at this time

We don't have one yet. I'd like to see what you come up with :) 

Explanation of the sign-up link you sent me and how you want that to be incorporated in the site. I can just add a button that says 'sign up' but I want to make sure I make it fit on the website.
It could be one of the five pages, and maybe it could say "Carrier Registration"

If you have a specific color palate in mind for the project, or you can use https://coolors.co/generate to generate color palettes (just hit space)
I'll check this out and let you know what works.

Any media that you want to display on the website
I will work on getting some things together for this, not sure if I will have much but let me know of some typical things that people like to put in there website in regard to this

Any text that you want to display on the website
I will also work on this later, once we have a general format outline, I will get each page drafted with whatever test I want to put on
